Hello, my name is Hector Sosa and I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst. I work with Dr. Nilanjana Dasgupta in the Implicit Social Cognition Lab. My research interests include supporting underrepresented/underserved students in STEM and how social context influences  intergroup relations. 

I am also interested in applying data science techniques to explore social issues in educational settings. In addition, I am interested in exploring the biases of machine learning algorithms and ways to mitigate them.
