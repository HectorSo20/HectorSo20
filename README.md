Hello, my name is Hector Sosa and I am a 1st year PhD student at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst. I work with Dr. Nilanjana Dasgupta in the Implicit Social Cognition Lab. My research interests include supporting underrepresented/underserved students in STEM, how social context influences implicit biases, and intergroup relations. 

I am also interested in applying data science techniques to explore social issues in an educational setting. In addition, I am interested in exploring the biases of machine learning algorithms and ways to mitigate them.
