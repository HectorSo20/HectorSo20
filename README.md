Currently, I am a rising third-year Social Psychology Ph.D. student at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst working with Dr. Nilanjana Dasgupta and Dr. Evelyn Mercado. My primary areas of research focus on supporting underrepresented/underserved students in STEM and how social context influences intergroup relations. 

As a former McNair Scholar and a student in the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), I am interested in creating data-driven interventions and policies to better support underrepresented students' retention and success in schools.
